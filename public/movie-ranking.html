<h1>The Best Movies According to Lulu</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragons</h3>
 <p>I really love the main actress in this film, Yu Jiaolong. She is rebellious,brave and resillent who inspires me a lot especially when i was in the downs in my life.Her desire for freedom, her rebellion against the rules, and the deep loneliness behind her strength all made her painfully relatable. Jen is not perfect — and that’s exactly why she’s powerful. She reminded me that sometimes, the bravest thing a woman can do is to break away from what’s expected and chase the life that truly belongs to her.

 <h3>The Pirates of the Caribbean </h3>
<p>Pirates of the Caribbean has always held a special place in my heart. I admire the main character for his bravery, kindness, and sense of humor — he’s not just a pirate, but a truly unforgettable soul.
More importantly, this film carries the memories of my youth. Back in high school, after every geography exam, our teacher would secretly play Pirates of the Caribbean for the whole class during evening study sessions. We all sat together, watching it with excitement and laughter.
Those rare moments became the brightest highlights in my otherwise monotonous school life. The film didn't just entertain me — it sparked a longing for the world beyond, and planted a seed of adventure in my heart.

<h3>Young Woman and the Sea</h3>
<P>Young Woman and the Sea is a deeply inspiring film based on the true story of Gertrude Ederle, the first woman to swim across the English Channel. What touched me most was her unwavering determination in the face of doubt and adversity.
She wasn’t just fighting the waves — she was challenging the limits set by society for women. Her courage, resilience, and quiet strength left a lasting impact on me. It's a reminder that even when the world says “you can’t,” your heart can say “watch me.”</P>
